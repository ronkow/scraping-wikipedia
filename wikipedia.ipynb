      "Yesterday is a 2019 romantic comedy film directed by Danny Boyle and written by Richard Curtis, based on a story  by Jack Barth and Curtis. It stars Himesh Patel as struggling musician Jack Malik, who, after an accident, finds himself the only person who remembers the Beatles and becomes famous after taking credit for their songs. The film also stars Lily James as the protagonist's childhood friend and love interest, Kate McKinnon as his manager, and Ed Sheeran as a fictionalised version of himself.\n",
      "The project was announced in March 2018. Filming began the following month around England, particularly Suffolk. Photography also took place at Wembley Stadium, Principality Stadium and in Los Angeles. The filmmakers paid $10 million for the rights to use the Beatles' music; although none of the Beatles were involved, Boyle received blessings from them and their families.\n",
      "Yesterday had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on 4 May 2019, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 28 June 2019, by Universal Pictures. The film grossed $142 million worldwide against a production budget of $26 million, and received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the premise, performances and musical sequences, but criticism of the familiarity and not taking the concept further.\n",
